This package provides a collection of utilities and integration tools which enhance the basic SimpleITK Python package functionality. Among other things, it enables data exchange between SimpleITK and other packages (e.g. [vtk](https://vtk.org/), [dask](https://www.dask.org/)) and provides additional useful capabilities such as handling [SimpleITK](https://github.com/SimpleITK/SimpleITK) messages using standard Python logging.
